# Drag&Drop implementation React for Webpacks

I've created this component for frontend devs to avoid struggle I was facing with setting up 'react-beautiful-dnd' properly. This component, after setting up Type to your own requirements and feeding it with proper data, allows users to drag&drop items between two lists.
